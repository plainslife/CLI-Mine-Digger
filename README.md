### üß† How to Play Minesweeper

    Objective: Clear the board without triggering any mines.

    Board: A grid of cells; some hide mines, others are safe.

    Gameplay:

        First move is always safe.

        Click a cell to reveal its content.

        Numbers tell how many mines are adjacent.

        Flag suspicious cells to mark potential mines.

    Winning: Clear all safe cells and flag all mines correctly.

    Losing: Click a mine and it‚Äôs game over.

    Flags: Flagged cells cannot be revealed unless unflagged first.

### Instructions to Run and Play the Program

Make sure that the Code Mind Digger folder is downloaded before continuing ...

Compiling (this assumes that you have mingw as your c++ compiler):
1. First please open you terminal (cmd, powershell, etc.), 
   And make sure you are at the directory where the program is located, 
   i.e in the Code Mine Digger folder that you downloaded. 
   You can check the directory you are in using the command: pwd
2. To move to a directory you can use the command: cd [programDirectory]
3. Compile the two libraries into object using:
       * g++ -c src/assets.cpp -I include -o obj/assets.o
       * g++ -c src/rankings.cpp -I include -o obj/rankings.o

Building:
4. After turning the two files to object link it together with the main files:
       * g++ src/main.cpp obj/assets.o obj/rankings.o -I include -o bin/mines
       note: you can name the excutable mines with any name you want      

Run and play the game:
5. The run the executable using: (or if you change the name of the excutable please use that)

### How to Play Minesweeper

1. Objective: The goal of Minesweeper is to clear the board without detonating any mines.
2. Game Board: You are presented with a grid of cells. Some cells contain mines, and others are safe.
3. Game Rules:
       - First move is safe
       - Click a cell to reveal its content.
       - If a mine is revealed, you lose the game.
       - If a number is revealed, it indicates the number of adjacent mines.
       - Use the numbers to deduce the locations of mines.
       - Put a flag in a cell that is a potential mine.

4. Winning: You win when all safe cells are uncovered and all mines are correctly flagged.
5. Losing: You lose if you click on a mine.
7. Flagging: You can put a flag at a cell with potential mine, 
             when a cell is flag the player cannot dig/reveal the cell,
             it need to be unflage first.

##### Û∞ñ∑ Compiling  
(*Assumes you have [MinGW](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/) installed*)
1. Open your terminal (CMD, PowerShell, etc.) and navigate to the Code Mine Digger directory
2. Compile the two libraries into object using:
       * g++ -c src/assets.cpp -I include -o obj/assets.o
       * g++ -c src/rankings.cpp -I include -o obj/rankings.o

##### ÔÉÅ  Building
3. After turning the two files to object link it together with the main files:
       * g++ src/main.cpp obj/assets.o obj/rankings.o -I include -o bin/mines
       note: you can name the excutable mines with any name you want       

##### ÔÅã Run and play the game:
4. The run the executable using: (or if you change the name of the excutable please use that) 
       * ./bin/mines 

#### üéØ How to Play Minesweeper
1. Objective: Clear the board without triggering any mines.
2. Board: A grid of cells; some contain mines, others are safe.
3. Gameplay:
    First move is always safe.
    Click a cell to reveal its content.
    Numbers show how many mines are adjacent.
    Use flags to mark potential mines.
4. Winning: Clear all safe cells.
5. Losing: Clicking a mine ends the game.
6. Flagging: Flagged cells cannot be revealed until unflagged.

#### Game modes

       - Choose from Easy, Medium, or Hard.
       - Board size and mine count adjust based on difficulty.
2. Custom mode 
       - You decide the board size and mine count.
       - Minimum board size is 3√ó3, and mines must be fewer than total cells.
3. Infinite Roulette mode 
       - Random board and mine count every round.
       - Play continues until the player quits or loses.
       
#### Leaderboard
1. Difficulty Levels mode
       - Ranked by time taken to win.
       - Faster times = higher ranks.
2. Infinite Roulette mode
       - Ranked by win streaks.
       - The longer the streak, the higher the rank.

By the way I'm just a begginner in programming, and i'm sure there is still alot to improve in this program.
Thanks you for checking the game, I hope you have fun playing!
